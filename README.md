# Recipe Box - Redux

## Project Description

It consists of a React App that stores cooking recipes. Although probably not necessary, I decided to use Redux for state management just to showcase my skills using it. You can add, edit and delete your recipes, and switch between them using a simple dropdown menu. The editing box is a Modal containing a state controlled form. The styling is based on daisyUI's Tailwind CSS Components.

## Technology Stack

- Basic HTML5 for the app entry point.
- Tailwind CSS and daisyUI Tailwind Components for styling, along with minimal custom CSS for the fonts.
- React
- Redux / Redux Toolkit
- Vite
- Node Package Manager
- Node.js
- Local Storage for storing the recipes between sessions.

## How to Install and Run this App

- Make sure you have the latest versions of Node.js and Node Package Manager installed on your machine.
- Clone this repository to a local folder on your machine.
- Open a terminal in the main folder of the project and run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
- Finally, run `npm run dev`, then navigate to http://localhost:5173/ in your web browser to use the app.
